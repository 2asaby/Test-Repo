* to build docker image from Dockerfile and push that image to docker hub in jenkinsfile :
make sure to install Docker and Docker pipeline plugins to make jenkins run docker and put jenkins user in docker user group
1- stage ('Docker Build and Push') {
            steps {
                script {
                    echo 'Building and pushing to Docker hub'
                    docker.build("2asaby/devops:jenkins-test")

                    docker.withRegistry('https://index.docker.io/v1/', 'dockerhub credential id') {
