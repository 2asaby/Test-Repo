cat /etc/group (show all user groups)
git remote -v (show existing connection to which repo on github)
ssh-keygen (create ssh rsa public and private key)
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa (change type of generated public and private keys from rsa to ecdsa)

* to build docker image from Dockerfile and push that image to docker hub in jenkinsfile :
make sure to install Docker and Docker pipeline plugins to make jenkins run docker and put jenkins user in docker user group
1- stage ('Docker Build and Push') {
            steps {
                script {
                    echo 'Building and pushing to Docker hub'
                    docker.build("2asaby/devops:jenkins-test")

                    docker.withRegistry('https://index.docker.io/v1/', 'dockerhub credential id') {
                        docker.image("2asaby/devops:jenkins-test").push()
                    }
                }
            }        
        }

2- stage('Docker build and push') {
            steps {
                echo 'building and push docker image to dockerhub'
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'dockerhub credential id',
                                                  passwordVariable: 'DOCKER_REGISTRY_PWD',
                                                  usernameVariable: 'DOCKER_REGISTRY_USER')]) {
                    script {
                        sh '''
                            docker build -t 2asaby/devops:jenkins-test .
                            echo ${DOCKER_REGISTRY_PWD} | docker login -u ${DOCKER_REGISTRY_USER} --password-stdin
                            docker push 2asaby/devops:jenkins-test
                        '''

                    }

                }

            }

        }


* Ansible :
to install Ansible on machine we must meet that prerequisites :
1- login as root 
2- add new user (sudo useradd -m <ansible>) and set password (sudo passwd ansible )
3- sudo vim /etc/sudoers 
( User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL  // this previously exist 
ansible  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL //add this line and type :wq! to force save to Granting Administrative Privileges )
4-we can Granting Administrative Privileges by using (sudo usermod -aG sudo ansible)
